This project is based on Climatune ,Brought to you by a partnership between AccuWeather and Spotify, Climatune aims to give us audiophiles an insight into how the weather affects what we listen to.

 Through a yearlong study comparing 85 billion anonymized streams on Spotify in over 900 cities nationwide, AccuWeather and Spotify analyzed the impact weather has on the music people listen to. Conclusions included:

• Sunny days typically encourage listening to happier and higher-energy music.

• Rainy days bring lower-energy, sadder-sounding music with more acoustic vs. electronic sounds.

• Snowy days encourage more instrumental music.

However, there are some variations in weather/listening behavior based on location. For example, in the U.S.:

• New York City and Philadelphia listeners are the most affected by bad weather; with residents of these cities substantially changing their listening when it rains.

• Chicagoans get excited by the rain and stream happier music.
